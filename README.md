This is my library management system and it allows you to add books, add users, view the books you added, view the users you added, lets you check out books, and lets you check in books. I would follow a similar format for how the example output inputted their choices, add a book, add a user, check in a book, view and serach for users and books, and then check out a book to view all the functions of this program. Combined classes into one program to make it easier to compile, you should be able to copy and paste this into an online compiler.
